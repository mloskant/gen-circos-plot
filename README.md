# gen-circos-plot
The program gen-circos-plot is used to visualize 2D miRNA folding and protein binding sites. It uses miRNA coordinates (BED file), the mapped binding sites (BED file) and the genome (FASTA file) to create a CIRCOS plot of the folded miRNA with binding sites marked. The package pyCircos is used for this.
